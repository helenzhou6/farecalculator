/**
 * Calculates the week total (based on parameter oyster or contactless passed as argument)
 * @function
  * @param {function - string} conDayTotal or oysterDayTotal - to calculate using oyster or contactless 
 * @param {object days} complex object containing array of days, and within each day an object for each journey
 * @param {object} info - is an object with {
 			options: {object that has minTravelcard: num and maxTravelcard: num}, 
 			data }
 * @returns {number} - total cheapest oyster or contactless fare for that week
 * @description It also deducts the automatic offpeak refunds for zones 4-6 if off peak daily cap is met more than once each week
 		e.g.:

          maxTravelcard: maxNum(weekCap),
