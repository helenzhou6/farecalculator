//Off peak vs on peak singles (esp including out of zone 1 to zone 1 in evening is offpeak exception)
//Offpeak daily cap discounts - keep track when daily cap reached but only travelled off peak (if going to do off peak oyster cum totals then would know this)
//possibility of altering oyster so reflects off peak -- then could add  the Railcard or Gold card discount to your Oyster and 1-8  zones or to 9 without watford
//CAN DO APPRENTICE, 18+ STUDENT, 16+ ZIP, JOB CENTRE ON OYSTER - as no diff bw off peak / on peak daily caps

//THIS METHOD RELIES ON THE FACT THAT:
//- zone x to x fare is the same as zone x-1 to zone x fare
//- Assumes daily caps always start at zone 1 (else need min single < capped zone IFs)

// Most combos (without a gap between the 2 travelcards) - extension fare as just between:
//----> COULD JUST UPDATE THE MAX ZONE AND USE SAME CALULCATIONS AS DAILY??? min travel = 1
// - maximum zone of daily or travelcard cap + 1 to maximum single zone (if min single <= max zone of daily or travelcard cap & max single > max zone of daily or travelcard cap)
// - OR both within min and maxcapped = free
// - ELSE just both outside capped zones = full fare


// HOWEVER for zone 4-5 weekly and 1-2 daily: have gap of zone 3 and 6 / for zone 4-6 weekly and 1-2 daily: gap of zone 3 / if weekly 5-6 and 1-2 daily: gap 3 and 4 / weekly 5-6 and daily 1-3: gap zone 4
//IF difference between min weekly and max daily cap > 1
// then min gap zone = max daily cap +1 & max gap zone = min weekly gap - 1

//IF min single <= min gap zone && max single >= max gap zone but max single <= max weekly zone
// then charge min to max gap fare
//IF min single zone <= min gap zone && max single > max weekly zone
// then charge cheapest: full fare or max weekly + 1 to max single zone& & gap fare
//IF min single and max single both > max weekly zone (or both < min daily) OR min single zone > min gap zone && max single zone < max gap zone
// then charge single min to single max fare
//ELSE (IF both min and max singles within min and max daily / both min and max singles within min and max weekly)
// then charge 0 - should swap with above

// Remember calculate without any daily caps - should be similar to daily calculations
