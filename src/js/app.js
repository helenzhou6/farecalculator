//TO DO
//Off peak vs on peak singles (esp including out of zone 1 to zone 1 in evening is offpeak exception)
//Offpeak daily cap discounts - keep track when daily cap reached but only travelled off peak (if going to do off peak oyster cum totals then would know this)
//possibility of altering oyster so reflects off peak -- then could add  the Railcard or Gold card discount to your Oyster and 1-8  zones or to 9 without watford
//CAN DO APPRENTICE, 18+ STUDENT, 16+ ZIP, JOB CENTRE ON OYSTER - as no diff bw off peak / on peak daily caps
//NB Weekly capping is always anytime & daily capping always starts at zone 1
